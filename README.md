# Presentation YMMOR

This is the branch for the slides to be presented at the [YMMOR conference](https://www.uni-muenster.de/MathematicsMuenster/events/2022/YMCN-model-order-reduction.shtml) at WWU Münster.

The topic is the paper **Keil T, Mechelli L, Ohlberger M, Schindler F, Volkwein S:** "A non-conforming dual approach for adaptive Trust-Region Reduced Basis approximation of PDE-constrained optimization" in ESAIM: Mathematical Modelling and Numerical Analysis (M2AN) Vol. 55, 2021, pp 1239–1269.
Theory and data from this paper is used extensively.
The raw data may be found in the [paper's repository](https://github.com/TiKeil/NCD-corrected-TR-RB-approach-for-pde-opt).
