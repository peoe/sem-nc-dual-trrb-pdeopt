# Seminar on "A NON-CONFORMING DUAL APPROACH FOR ADAPTIVE TRUST-REGION REDUCED BASIS APPROXIMATION OF PDE-CONSTRAINED OPTIMIZATION"

This repository contains all material used for the seminar on Advanced Numerical Methods and Applications and the YMMOR conference at WWU Münster.

The main paper is **Keil T, Mechelli L, Ohlberger M, Schindler F, Volkwein S:** "A non-conforming dual approach for adaptive Trust-Region Reduced Basis approximation of PDE-constrained optimization" in ESAIM: Mathematical Modelling and Numerical Analysis (M2AN) Vol. 55, 2021, pp 1239–1269.

The files contained here are:
* `handout`: the short reader highlighting the contents of the paper. This is intended for fellow students studying for a master's degree.
* `pres`: the presentation given to fellow master's students. The duration of the talk was intended to be 60 minutes.
* `pres-ymmor`: the presentation given at the YMMOR conference at WWU Münster. This talk is designed to last 20 minutes.
