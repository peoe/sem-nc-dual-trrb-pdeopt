   abstract = {During the last decades, reduced basis (RB) methods have been developed to a wide methodology for model reduction of problems that are governed by parametrized partial differential equations (P 2 DEs). In particular equations of elliptic and parabolic type for linear, low polynomial or monotonic nonlinearities have been treated successfully by RB methods using finite element schemes. Due to the characteristic offline-online decomposition, the reduced models often become suitable for a multi-query or real-time setting, where simulation results, such as field-variables or output estimates, can be approximated reliably and rapidly for varying parameters. In the current study, we address a certain class of time-dependent evolution schemes with explicit discretization operators that are arbitrarily parameter dependent. We extend the RB-methodology to these cases by applying the empirical interpolation method to localized discretization operators. The main technical ingredients are: (i) generation of a collateral reduced basis modelling the effects of the discretization operator under parameter variations in the offline-phase and (ii) an online simulation scheme based on a numerical subgrid and localized evaluations of the evolution operator. We formulate an a-posteriori error estimator for quantification of the resulting reduced simulation error. Numerical experiments on a parametrized convection problem, discretized with a finite volume scheme, demonstrate the applicability of the model reduction technique. We obtain a parametrized reduced model, which enables parameter variation with fast simulation response. We quantify the computational gain with respect to the non-reduced model and investigate the error convergence.},

   abstract = {We present a new approach to treating nonlinear operators in reduced basis approximations of parametrized evolution equations. Our approach is based on empirical interpolation of nonlinear differential operators and their Fréchet derivatives. Efficient offline/online decomposition is obtained for discrete operators that allow an efficient evaluation for a certain set of interpolation functionals. An a posteriori error estimate for the resulting reduced basis method is derived and analyzed numerically. We introduce a new algorithm, the PODEI-greedy algorithm, which constructs the reduced basis spaces for the empirical interpolation and for the numerical scheme in a synchronized way. The approach is applied to nonlinear parabolic and hyperbolic equations based on explicit or implicit finite volume discretizations. We show that the resulting reduced scheme is able to capture the evolution of both smooth and discontinuous solutions. In case of symmetries of the problem, the approach realizes an automatic and intuitive space-compression or even space-dimensionality reduction. We perform empirical investigations of the error convergence and run-times. In all cases we obtain a good run-time acceleration. © 2012 Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics.},

   abstract = {A Petrov-Galerkin projection method is proposed for reducing the dimension of a discrete non-linear static or dynamic computational model in view of enabling its processing in real time. The right reduced-order basis is chosen to be invariant and is constructed using the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition method. The left reduced-order basis is selected to minimize the two-norm of the residual arising at each Newton iteration. Thus, this basis is iteration-dependent, enables capturing of non-linearities, and leads to the globally convergent Gauss-Newton method. To avoid the significant computational cost of assembling the reduced-order operators, the residual and action of the Jacobian on the right reduced-order basis are each approximated by the product of an invariant, large-scale matrix, and an iteration-dependent, smaller one. The invariant matrix is computed using a data compression procedure that meets proposed consistency requirements. The iteration-dependent matrix is computed to enable the least-squares reconstruction of some entries of the approximated quantities. The results obtained for the solution of a turbulent flow problem and several non-linear structural dynamics problems highlight the merit of the proposed consistency requirements. They also demonstrate the potential of this method to significantly reduce the computational cost associated with high-dimensional non-linear models while retaining their accuracy. © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

   abstract = {A dimension reduction method called discrete empirical interpolation is proposed and shown to dramatically reduce the computational complexity of the popular proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) method for constructing reduced-order models for time dependent and/or parametrized nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs). In the presence of a general nonlinearity, the standard POD-Galerkin technique reduces dimension in the sense that far fewer variables are present, but the complexity of evaluating the nonlinear term remains that of the original problem. The original empirical interpolation method (EIM) is a modification of POD that reduces the complexity of evaluating the nonlinear term of the reduced model to a cost proportional to the number of reduced variables obtained by POD. We propose a discrete empirical interpolation method (DEIM), a variant that is suitable for reducing the dimension of systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) of a certain type. As presented here, it is applicable to ODEs arising from finite difference discretization of time dependent PDEs and/or parametrically dependent steady state problems. However, the approach extends to arbitrary systems of nonlinear ODEs with minor modification. Our contribution is a greatly simplified description of the EIM in a finite-dimensional setting that possesses an error bound on the quality of approximation. An application of DEIM to a finite difference discretization of the one-dimensional FitzHugh-Nagumo equations is shown to reduce the dimension from 1024 to order 5 variables with negligible error over a long-time integration that fully captures nonlinear limit cycle behavior. We also demonstrate applicability in higher spatial dimensions with similar state space dimension reduction and accuracy results. © 2010 Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics.},

   abstract = {Given a Banach space X and one of its compact sets F, we consider the problem of finding a good n-dimensional space X n⊂X which can be used to approximate the elements of F. The best possible error we can achieve for such an approximation is given by the Kolmogorov width dn(F)X. However, finding the space which gives this performance is typically numerically intractable. Recently, a new greedy strategy for obtaining good spaces was given in the context of the reduced basis method for solving a parametric family of PDEs. The performance of this greedy algorithm was initially analyzed in Buffa et al. (Modél. Math. Anal. Numér. 46:595-603, 2012) in the case X=H is a Hilbert space. The results of Buffa et al. (Modél. Math. Anal. Numér. 46:595-603, 2012) were significantly improved upon in Binev et al. (SIAM J. Math. Anal. 43:1457-1472, 2011). The purpose of the present paper is to give a new analysis of the performance of such greedy algorithms. Our analysis not only gives improved results for the Hilbert space case but can also be applied to the same greedy procedure in general Banach spaces. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

   abstract = {Parameter optimization problems constrained by partial differential equations (PDEs) appear in many science and engineering applications. Solving these op-timization problems may require a prohibitively large number of computationally expensive PDE solves, especially if the dimension of the design space is large. It is therefore advantageous to replace expensive high-dimensional PDE solvers (e.g., finite element) with lower-dimension surrogate models. In this paper, the reduced basis (RB) model reduction method is used in conjunction with a trust region opti-mization framework to accelerate PDE-constrained parameter optimization. Novel a posteriori error bounds on the RB cost and cost gradient for quadratic cost func-tionals (e.g., least squares) are presented, and used to guarantee convergence to the optimum of the high-fidelity model. The proposed certified RB trust region ap-proach uses high-fidelity solves to update the RB model only if the approximation is no longer sufficiently accurate, reducing the number of full-fidelity solves required. We consider problems governed by elliptic and parabolic PDEs and present numer-ical results for a thermal fin model problem in which we are able to reduce the number of full solves necessary for the optimization by up to 86\%.},

   abstract = {Solving optimization problems subject to constraints given in terms of partial dif- ferential equations (PDEs) with additional constraints on the controls and/or states is one of the most challenging problems in the context of industrial, medical and economical applications, where the transition from model-based numerical simu- lations to model-based design and optimal control is crucial. For the treatment of such optimization problems the interaction of optimization techniques and numer- ical simulation plays a central role. After proper discretization, the number of op- timization variables varies between 103 and 1010. It is only very recently that the enormous advances in computing power have made it possible to attack problems of this size. However, in order to accomplish this task it is crucial to utilize and fur- ther explore the specific mathematical structure of optimization problems with PDE constraints, and to develop new mathematical approaches concerning mathematical analysis, structure exploiting algorithms, and discretization, with a special focus on prototype applications. The present book provides amodern introduction to the rapidly developing math- ematical field of optimization with PDE constraints. The first chapter introduces to the analytical background and optimality theory for optimization problems with PDEs. Optimization problems with PDE-constraints are posed in infinite dimen- sional spaces. Therefore, functional analytic techniques, function space theory, as well as existence- and uniqueness results for the underlying PDE are essential to study the existence of optimal solutions and to derive optimality conditions. These results form the foundation of efficient optimizationmethods in function space, their adequate numerical realization, mesh independence results and error estimators. The chapter starts with an introduction to the necessary background in functional analy- sis, Sobolev spaces and the theory ofweak solutions for elliptic and parabolic PDEs. These ingredients are then applied to study PDE-constrained optimization problems.},

We derive efficient localizable a posteriori error estimates for the primal and dual equations of the optimality system, as well as for the two-scale reduced objective functional. While the relaxation of the outer trust-region optimization loop still allows for a rigorous convergence result, the resulting method converges much faster due to larger step sizes in the initial phase of the iterative algorithms. The resulting algorithm is parallelized in order to take advantage of the localization. Numerical experiments are given for a multiscale thermal block benchmark problem. The experiments demonstrate the efficiency of the approach, particularly for large scale problems, where methods based on traditional finite element approximation schemes are prohibitive or fail entirely.},

   abstract = {If $f: \mathbb\{R\}^\{n\} \to \mathbb\{R\}$ is twice continuously differentiable, f′(u)=0 and f″(u) is positive definite, then u is a local minimizer of f. This paper surveys the extension of this well known second order sufficient optimality condition to the case $f: U \to \mathbb\{R\}$, where U is an infinite-dimensional linear normed space. The reader will be guided from the case of finite dimensions via a brief discussion of the calculus of variations and the optimal control of ordinary differential equations to the control of nonlinear partial differential equations, where U is a function space. In particular, the following questions will be addressed: Is the extension to infinite dimensions straightforward or will unexpected difficulties occur? How have second order sufficient optimality conditions to be modified, if simple inequality constraints are imposed on u? Why do we need second order conditions and how can they be applied? If they are important, are we able to check if they are fulfilled? It turns out that infinite dimensions cause new difficulties that do not occur in finite dimensions. We will be faced with the surprising fact that the space, where f″(u) exists can be useless to ensure positive definiteness of the quadratic form v↦f″(u)v2. In this context, the famous two-norm discrepancy, its consequences, and techniques for overcoming this difficulty are explained. To keep the presentation simple, the theory is developed for problems in function spaces with simple box constraints of the form α≤u≤β. The theory of second order conditions in the control of partial differential equations is presented exemplarily for the nonlinear heat equation. Different types of critical cones are introduced, where the positivity of f″(u) must be required. Their form depends on whether a so-called Tikhonov regularization term is part of the functional f or not. In this context, the paper contains also new results that lead to quadratic growth conditions in the strong sense. As a first application of second order sufficient conditions, the stability of optimal solutions with respect to perturbations of the data of the control problem is discussed. Second, their use in analyzing the discretization of control problems by finite elements is studied. A survey on further related topics, open questions, and relevant literature concludes the paper.},

   abstract = {We present a technique for the rapid and reliable prediction of linear-functional outputs of elliptic partial differential equations with affine parameter dependence. The essential components are (i) rapidly convergent global reduced-basis approximations - (Galerkin) projection onto a space WN spanned by solutions of the governing partial differential equation at N selected points in parameter space; (ii) a posteriori error estimation relaxations of the error-residual equation that provide inexpensive yet sharp bounds for the error in the outputs of interest; and (iii) off-line/on-line computational procedures methods which decouple the generation and projection stages of the approximation process. The operation count for the on-line stage - in which, given a new parameter value, we calculate the output of interest and associated error bound - depends only on N (typically very small) and the parametric complexity of the problem. In this paper we develop new a posteriori error estimation procedures for noncoercive linear, and certain nonlinear, problems that yield rigorous and sharp error statements for all N. We consider three particular examples: the Helmholtz (reduced-wave) equation; a cubically nonlinear Poisson equation; and Burgers equation - a model for incompressible Navier-Stokes. The Helmholtz (and Burgers) example introduce our new lower bound constructions for the requisite inf-sup (singular value) stability factor; the cubic nonlin-earity exercises symmetry factorization procedures necessary for treatment of high-order Galerkin summations in the (say) residual dual-norm calculation; and the Burgers equation illustrates our accommodation of potentially multiple solution branches in our a posteriori error statement. Numerical results are presented that demonstrate the rigor, sharpness, and efficiency of our proposed error bounds, and the application of these bounds to adaptive (optimal) approximation. © 2003 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.},

   abstract = {Iterative approximation algorithms are successfully applied in parametric approximation tasks. In particular, reduced basis methods make use of the so-called Greedy algorithm for approximating solution sets of parametrized partial differential equations. Recently, a priori convergence rate statements for this algorithm have been given (Buffa et al. 2009, Binev et al. 2010). The goal of the current study is the extension to time-dependent problems, which are typically approximated using the POD—Greedy algorithm (Haasdonk and Ohlberger 2008). In this algorithm, each greedy step is invoking a temporal compression step by performing a proper orthogonal decomposition (POD). Using a suitable coefficient representation of the POD—Greedy algorithm, we show that the existing convergence rate results of the Greedy algorithm can be extended. In particular, exponential or algebraic convergence rates of the Kolmogorov n-widths are maintained by the POD—Greedy algorithm. © EDP Sciences, SMAI 2013.},
