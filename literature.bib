   abstract = {Parameter optimization problems constrained by partial differential equations (PDEs) appear in many science and engineering applications. Solving these op-timization problems may require a prohibitively large number of computationally expensive PDE solves, especially if the dimension of the design space is large. It is therefore advantageous to replace expensive high-dimensional PDE solvers (e.g., finite element) with lower-dimension surrogate models. In this paper, the reduced basis (RB) model reduction method is used in conjunction with a trust region opti-mization framework to accelerate PDE-constrained parameter optimization. Novel a posteriori error bounds on the RB cost and cost gradient for quadratic cost func-tionals (e.g., least squares) are presented, and used to guarantee convergence to the optimum of the high-fidelity model. The proposed certified RB trust region ap-proach uses high-fidelity solves to update the RB model only if the approximation is no longer sufficiently accurate, reducing the number of full-fidelity solves required. We consider problems governed by elliptic and parabolic PDEs and present numer-ical results for a thermal fin model problem in which we are able to reduce the number of full solves necessary for the optimization by up to 86%.},

   abstract = {Solving optimization problems subject to constraints given in terms of partial dif- ferential equations (PDEs) with additional constraints on the controls and/or states is one of the most challenging problems in the context of industrial, medical and economical applications, where the transition from model-based numerical simu- lations to model-based design and optimal control is crucial. For the treatment of such optimization problems the interaction of optimization techniques and numer- ical simulation plays a central role. After proper discretization, the number of op- timization variables varies between 103 and 1010. It is only very recently that the enormous advances in computing power have made it possible to attack problems of this size. However, in order to accomplish this task it is crucial to utilize and fur- ther explore the specific mathematical structure of optimization problems with PDE constraints, and to develop new mathematical approaches concerning mathematical analysis, structure exploiting algorithms, and discretization, with a special focus on prototype applications. The present book provides amodern introduction to the rapidly developing math- ematical field of optimization with PDE constraints. The first chapter introduces to the analytical background and optimality theory for optimization problems with PDEs. Optimization problems with PDE-constraints are posed in infinite dimen- sional spaces. Therefore, functional analytic techniques, function space theory, as well as existence- and uniqueness results for the underlying PDE are essential to study the existence of optimal solutions and to derive optimality conditions. These results form the foundation of efficient optimizationmethods in function space, their adequate numerical realization, mesh independence results and error estimators. The chapter starts with an introduction to the necessary background in functional analy- sis, Sobolev spaces and the theory ofweak solutions for elliptic and parabolic PDEs. These ingredients are then applied to study PDE-constrained optimization problems.},

   abstract = {In this contribution, we introduce and analyze a new relaxed and localized version of the trust-region method for PDE-constrained parameter optimization in the context of multiscale problems. As an underlying efficient discretization framework, we rely on the Petrov-Galerkin localized orthogonal decomposition method and its recently introduced two-scale reduced basis approximation. We derive efficient localizable a posteriori error estimates for the primal and dual equations of the optimality system, as well as for the two-scale reduced objective functional. While the relaxation of the outer trust-region optimization loop still allows for a rigorous convergence result, the resulting method converges much faster due to larger step sizes in the initial phase of the iterative algorithms. The resulting algorithm is parallelized in order to take advantage of the localization. Numerical experiments are given for a multiscale thermal block benchmark problem. The experiments demonstrate the efficiency of the approach, particularly for large scale problems, where methods based on traditional finite element approximation schemes are prohibitive or fail entirely.},

   abstract = {In this contribution we device and analyze improved variants of the non-conforming dual approach for trust-region reduced basis (TR-RB) approximation of PDE-constrained parameter optimization that has recently been introduced in [Keil et al.. A non-conforming dual approach for adaptive Trust-Region Reduced Basis approximation of PDE-constrained optimization. arXiv:2006.09297, 2020]. The proposed methods use model order reduction techniques for parametrized PDEs to significantly reduce the computational demand of parameter optimization with PDE constraints in the context of large-scale or multi-scale applications. The adaptive TR approach allows to localize the reduction with respect to the parameter space along the path of optimization without wasting unnecessary resources in an offline phase. The improved variants employ projected Newton methods to solve the local optimization problems within each TR step to benefit from high convergence rates. This implies new strategies in constructing the RB spaces, together with an estimate for the approximation of the hessian. Moreover, we present a new proof of convergence of the TR-RB method based on infinite-dimensional arguments, not restricted to the particular case of an RB approximation and provide an a posteriori error estimate for the approximation of the optimal parameter. Numerical experiments demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed methods.},

Each Trust-Region sub-problem is solved with the projected BFGS method. Moreover, we propose a non-conforming dual (NCD) approach to improve the standard RB approximation of the optimality system. Rigorous improved a posteriori error bounds are derived and used to prove convergence of the resulting NCD-corrected adaptive Trust-Region Reduced Basis algorithm.

   abstract = {If $f: \mathbb\{R\}^\{n\} \to \mathbb\{R\}$ is twice continuously differentiable, f′(u)=0 and f″(u) is positive definite, then u is a local minimizer of f. This paper surveys the extension of this well known second order sufficient optimality condition to the case $f: U \to \mathbb\{R\}$, where U is an infinite-dimensional linear normed space. The reader will be guided from the case of finite dimensions via a brief discussion of the calculus of variations and the optimal control of ordinary differential equations to the control of nonlinear partial differential equations, where U is a function space. In particular, the following questions will be addressed: Is the extension to infinite dimensions straightforward or will unexpected difficulties occur? How have second order sufficient optimality conditions to be modified, if simple inequality constraints are imposed on u? Why do we need second order conditions and how can they be applied? If they are important, are we able to check if they are fulfilled? It turns out that infinite dimensions cause new difficulties that do not occur in finite dimensions. We will be faced with the surprising fact that the space, where f″(u) exists can be useless to ensure positive definiteness of the quadratic form v↦f″(u)v2. In this context, the famous two-norm discrepancy, its consequences, and techniques for overcoming this difficulty are explained. To keep the presentation simple, the theory is developed for problems in function spaces with simple box constraints of the form α≤u≤β. The theory of second order conditions in the control of partial differential equations is presented exemplarily for the nonlinear heat equation. Different types of critical cones are introduced, where the positivity of f″(u) must be required. Their form depends on whether a so-called Tikhonov regularization term is part of the functional f or not. In this context, the paper contains also new results that lead to quadratic growth conditions in the strong sense. As a first application of second order sufficient conditions, the stability of optimal solutions with respect to perturbations of the data of the control problem is discussed. Second, their use in analyzing the discretization of control problems by finite elements is studied. A survey on further related topics, open questions, and relevant literature concludes the paper.},

Furthermore, they carry out both a priori and a posteriori error analysis. The whole mathematical presentation is made more stimulating by the use of representative examples of applicative interest in the context of both linear and nonlinear PDEs.
