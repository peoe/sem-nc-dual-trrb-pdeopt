\section{ROM Optimality Systems}

In the following, we want to consider optimality conditions for the reduced problem.
This will involve primal and dual spaces for the conditions, causing the easily computable gradients that one would usually use to derive error estimates to differ from the exact gradients.
Only a short overview of the ideas mentioned will be given here, but a longer description can be found in~\cite[Section 3]{Keil2021}.

If we consider~\eqref{StateEq} for our FOM and ROM problems~\eqref{FOMEq} and~\eqref{ROMEq}, we can see that the state equation can be restated through
\begin{equation*}
    e(u_\mu, \mu) = l_\mu(\cdot) - a_\mu(u_\mu, \cdot) \in V' \text{ or } V_N'.
\end{equation*}
We now define the \textbf{primal residual} by $Res_\mu^{pr}(u)[v] := l_\mu(v) - a_\mu(u, v)$.
Following~\cite[Corollary 1.3]{Hinze2009}, we get the optimality conditions in~\cite[Proposition 2.9]{Keil2021}, then derive from these the following dual relation
\begin{equation*}
    a_\mu(v, p_\mu) = \partial_u \mathcal{J}(u_\mu, \mu)[v] = j_\mu(v) + 2 k_\mu(v, u_\mu) \quad \forall v \in V \text{ or } V_N,
\end{equation*}
and finally define the \textbf{dual residual} in terms of the difference in the dual optimality condition $Res_\mu^{du}(u_\mu, p_\mu)[v] := j_\mu(v) + 2 k_\mu(v, u_\mu) - a_\mu(v, p_\mu)$.
By the same optimality conditions, all locally optimal points of~\eqref{OptiProb} have to satisfy
\begin{equation}\label{PrimalEq}
    Res_\mu^{pr}(u_\mu)[v] = 0 \qquad \forall v \in V \text{ or } V_N^{pr},
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}\label{DualEq}
    Res_\mu^{du}(u_\mu, p_\mu)[v] = 0 \qquad \forall v \in V \text{ or } V_N^{du}.
\end{equation}

In this and the following sections, $u_\mu$ will always denote the primal solution $u$ for some parameter $\mu$, and similarly $p_\mu$ the dual solution.
If necessary, we will denote the ROM solutions by $u_{N, \mu}$ ($p_{N, \mu}$ respectively), while we will avoid additional indices for the FOM solutions.

\subsection{Standard Approach for a ROM Optimality System}

We note here that as in~\cite[Section 3.2]{Keil2021} the primal and the dual spaces are in general not the same, even the dimensions may be assumed to differ.
Hence, when considering the exact gradient
